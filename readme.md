[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4131)

-------

## Introduction
This mod allows MP3, WAV, WMA, AAC, and audio OGG files that has been attached to a post to be played without manually downloading the attachment using the HTML5 audio tag.

This mod also allows a MP4, M4A, M4V, WebM, WMV, MOV, and video OGG files that has been attached to a post to be played without manually downloading the attachment using the HTML5 video tag.

Note: **OGG** format files are assumed to be video if the extension is **OGV**.  Detection has yet to be improved upon for determining the difference between audio and video OGG-formatted files.

## Admin Settings
In **Admin** -> **Forum** -> **Attachments and Avatars** -> **Attachment Settings**, there are two new options:

- Width of Audio Player element
- Width of Video Player element

## Inspiration & Credit
The Javascript code used was copied and adapted from this webpage: [JavaScript spoiler with a twist (collapsing up or down)](http://mxii.eu.org/2017/09/07/javascript-spoiler-with-a-twist-collapsing-up-or-down/)
