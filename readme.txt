[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows MP3, WAV, and audio OGG files that has been attached to a post to be played without manually downloading the attachment using the HTML5 audio tag.

As of [b]version 1.5[/b], a fallback audio player embed tag has been added in the hopes that it will allow the attachment to be played if HTML5 support isn't available.

This mod also allows a MP4, WebM, and video OGG files that has been attached to a post to be played without manually downloading the attachment using the HTML5 video tag.  In addition, a fallback video player embed tag has been added in the hopes that it will allow the attachment to be played if HTML5 support isn't available.

Note: [b]OGG[/b] format files are assumed to be video if the extension is [b]OGV[/b].  Detection has yet to be improved upon for determining the difference between audio and video OGG-formatted files.
